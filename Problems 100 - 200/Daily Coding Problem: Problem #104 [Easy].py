# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

# This problem was asked by Google.

# Determine whether a doubly linked list is a palindrome. What if itâ€™s singly
# linked?

# For example, 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 returns True while 1 -> 4 returns False.

from typing import *

"""

reverse the linked list then iterate through to see if they are the same or not. once pass the middle can return already.
