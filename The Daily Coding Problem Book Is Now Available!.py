It helped me so much. It distilled broad problem# categories into simple patterns that I could apply immediately.# 10/10 buy this book!# > — Kenneth, Software Engineer at Google# > Great book even for experienced developers# > I've been through and given many coding interviews in the Bay Area and the# questions in these books are very representative of the kinds of questions you# get asked. They might be a bit harder than the average one, so if you can solve# these you'll be able to solve a lot of similar problems. I'm already asubscriber# to the daily newsletter and I'm glad to have a physical copy with mewhile# studying.# > — Yogesh, Software Engineer at Uber# Buy The Book On Amazon [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1793296634] THANK YOU# Thank you, dear reader, for making this book possible.
